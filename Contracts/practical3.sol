PRACTICAL: Store address in state
CONCEPT: Address persistence
=========================================================

OBJECTIVE

- Learn how Solidity stores Ethereum addresses
- Understand persistent address storage on blockchain
- Learn how addresses are updated and retrieved
- Understand security risks of storing critical addresses

---------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS AN ADDRESS?
---------------------------------------------------------

An Ethereum address represents:
- user wallet
- smart contract
- admin account
- treasury wallet

Address type in Solidity:
address

Example:
0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835Cb2

---------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CONCEPT
---------------------------------------------------------

When an address is stored as a state variable:
- it is saved permanently in storage
- persists across transactions
- remains on blockchain until changed

---------------------------------------------------------
AUDITOR FOCUS
---------------------------------------------------------

Auditors check:

- Who can update stored address?
- Can attacker replace admin wallet?
- Is zero address validation missing?
- Can funds be redirected?
- Is address overwrite protected?

EXECUTION FLOW
=========================================================

INITIAL STATE

userAddress = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

This is called ZERO ADDRESS.

---------------------------------------------------------

CALL:
storeAddress(0x123...)

EVM ACTIONS:

1. Transaction reaches contract
2. Address arrives through calldata
3. EVM updates storage slot
4. Address stored permanently
5. Gas consumed for storage write

---------------------------------------------------------

CALL:
getAddress()

EVM ACTIONS:

1. Reads address from storage
2. Returns stored address
3. No state modification occurs

=========================================================
REMIX TESTING
=========================================================

NORMAL FLOW

STEP 1:
Deploy contract

EXPECTED:
userAddress() returns:

0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2:
Copy one Remix account address

Call:
storeAddress(<paste address>)

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 3:
Call:
userAddress()

EXPECTED:
Stored address returned correctly

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 4:
Store another address

EXPECTED:
Old address overwritten with new one

=========================================================
EDGE CASE TESTS
=========================================================

TEST:
Store zero address

Call:
storeAddress(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

EXPECTED:
Works successfully

---------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE

In real protocols,
zero address is often INVALID.

Reason:
Funds sent to zero address are usually lost forever.

=========================================================
STORAGE OBSERVATION
=========================================================

Storage slot example:

Initial:
slot0 => 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

After update:
slot0 => user wallet address

After another update:
slot0 overwritten with new address

=========================================================
SECURITY / AUDITOR MINDSET
=========================================================

CRITICAL AUDITOR CHECKS

---------------------------------------------------------
1. MISSING ACCESS CONTROL
---------------------------------------------------------

Currently ANYONE can update address.

Danger:
Attacker can replace important wallet.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. ZERO ADDRESS VALIDATION
---------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
Contract allows zero address.

Real-world issue:
Funds or ownership may become unusable.

Auditors often expect:

require(_newAddress != address(0))

---------------------------------------------------------
3. ADDRESS OVERWRITE RISK
---------------------------------------------------------

If address represents:
- owner
- treasury
- signer
- reward wallet

then unauthorized overwrite becomes critical vulnerability.

=========================================================
ATTACK THINKING
=========================================================

ATTACK SCENARIO

Suppose stored address is treasury wallet.

Attacker calls:

storeAddress(attackerWallet)

Now:
- future funds go to attacker
- protocol treasury hijacked

---------------------------------------------------------

ANOTHER ATTACK

Attacker sets:

address(0)

Impact:
- protocol functionality breaks
- funds may become inaccessible
- ownership can be destroyed

=========================================================
MINI CHALLENGE
=========================================================

Modify contract so that:

1. Only deployer can update address
2. Zero address should be rejected

HINT:

Use:
require(_newAddress != address(0))

=========================================================
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS LEARNED
=========================================================

- Solidity supports address type
- Addresses can be stored permanently
- State variables persist on-chain
- Storage updates overwrite old values
- Zero address is special
- Missing validation creates vulnerabilities
- Access control is essential
- Critical addresses must be protected

Audit Report:---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Missing Access Control and Zero Address Validation in storeAddress()

Severity: Medium

Reason: Unauthorized users can modify protocol state, and invalid addresses can be stored.

Location:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contract: StoreAddress

Function: storeAddress()

Vulnerability Description:

The `storeAddress()` function allows any external user to update the `userAddress` state variable because no access control mechanism is implemented.

Additionally, the function does not validate whether the supplied address is the zero address (`address(0)`).

As a result:

* Any user can overwrite the stored address.
* The contract may store an invalid address value.

Impact:--------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker can modify the stored address with arbitrary values.

If this address were used for critical protocol components such as:

* treasury wallet
* protocol administrator
* fee receiver
* reward distributor

then unauthorized updates could disrupt protocol operations.

Furthermore, storing the zero address may lead to:

* loss of administrative control
* inability to interact with intended contracts
* accidental fund loss

Proof of Concept:--------------------------------------------------------

Deploy the contract.

User A calls:

storeAddress(0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890)

Stored address becomes:

0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

An attacker calls:

storeAddress(0x9999999999999999999999999999999999999999)

The address is successfully overwritten.

An attacker can also call:

storeAddress(address(0))

The contract accepts the zero address and updates storage.

Root Cause:------------------------------------------------------------

The function is declared `public` without authorization checks.

No validation exists to prevent storage of the zero address.

Example vulnerable code:

function storeAddress(address _newAddress) public {
userAddress = _newAddress;
}

Recommendation:--------------------------------------------------------

Restrict updates to the contract owner and reject the zero address.



Example:

require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
require(_newAddress != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");

Patched Code:
*/

contract StoreAddress {


address public userAddress;
address public owner;

constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}

function storeAddress(address _newAddress) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
    require(_newAddress != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");

    userAddress = _newAddress;
}

function getAddress() public view returns (address) {
    return userAddress;
}


}
